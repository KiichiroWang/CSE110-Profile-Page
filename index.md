Hi! I'm **Kiichi** and I'm a **3rd year ICAM Major and CS Minor**. I primarily do __game development__ so I am very comfortable with C# and team-based work!

Currently for my computer science minor, here are the classes I've taken:
> CSE 8B,
> CSE 12,
> CSE 20,
> CSE 21,
> CSE 100

Here is some of my work: [https://kiichirowang.carrd.co](Some of my projects), the website is still super WIP so if nothing works I'll get to that...
Some of the games and software I've worked on in the past has been
1. Lots of video game platformers using Unity and C#
2. Task Management / To-do List Software using .Net frameworks
3. VR Puzzle Game

I really enjoy the process of brainstorming and conceptualizing in a team. As a team member I think I am best a facilitating meetings, note-taking, and organizing information like concept boards, meeting minutes, and etc. I really prioritize communication within a team and believe that the best meetings are in-person with the whole team. But maybe that's just a personal preference as I find online meetings harder lol.

As a person some of my hobbies are 
- Archery
- Drawing
- Game Development

I'm from the east coast Pennslyvania but I used to live in the bay area (San Bruno), near San Francisco for elementary school. I have 2 younger brothers both and a shiba dog back home!
